In the year of the rat, the stock market did well...

in 2020             Year of the Rat
a million candles   burned
for the help that   never came
but the stockmarket was well

In 2020, I was hired for a position which started 6 days after the deadline to sign-up for the 401K plan.  I dropped the maximum I could into a personal IRA and then took what I would have sent to the 401K into my own stock account.  To track it, I developed this notebook, originally called 'stockportfolio'.  At the end of 2020, I was showing about a 50% return on investment.  This led me to remember my Grandmother's words:  'You are not special...'.  The point is, 2020 for the stockmarket was an unusual year, saying you did well is like saying 'I shot a tiger' and leaving out that you were hunting in a zoo.
